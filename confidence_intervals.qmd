This page features confidence intervals' definition, interpretation, and programming.

# Definition

There are different versions of how to compute a confidence interval (CI) based on sample size and the shape of the parent distribution.

## CI for Means

The following example is for a $100 * (1 - \alpha) \%$ confidence interval for mean $\mu$ when the value of $\sigma$ is known:

$[\bar{x} - z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}, \bar{x} + z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}]$

## CI for Difference in Means

$\bar{x} - \bar{y} \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{x}^{2}}{n_x} + \frac{\sigma_{y}^{2}}{n_y}}$

## CI for Proportions and Difference in Proportions

# Interpretation

> Question: What does it mean to say that we are 95% confident that the true population mean is in this
interval?

> Answer: In repeated sampling, 95% of all CIs obtained from sampling will
actually contain the true population mean. The other 5% of CIs will not.
