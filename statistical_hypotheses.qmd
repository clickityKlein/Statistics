This page features theories involving statistical hypotheses, including:

- Null vs. Alternative Hypothesis
- Analogy
- Test Statistic
- Rejection Region & Significance Levels
- Type I and Type II Errors
- Power and Statistical Learning
- Bootstrapping
- Hypothesis Testing with Randomization

> A statistical hypothesis is a claim about the value of a parameter of a population characteristic.

# Competing Hypotheses

- $H_0$: Null Hypothesis
- $H_A$: Alternative Hypothesis

## Classic Jury Analogy

Consider a jury in a criminal trial. When a defendant is accused of a crime, the jury presumes
that they are not guilty.

- $H_0$: Not Guilty
- $H_A$: Guilty

The jury is then presented with evidence. If the evidence seems implausible under the
assumption of non-guilt, we might reject the null hypothesis of non-guilt, and claim that the
defendant is (likely) guilty.

> In the case of statistical hypothesis testing, we use data to find evidence, leading us to arrive at two possible conclusions:

- Reject the null hypothesis, $H_0$, in favor of the alternative hypothesis, $H_A$
- Fail to reject the null hypothesis, $H_0$

## Setting Up the Hypothesis Test

The *null hypothesis* will almost always be represented with equivalence. The *alternative hypothesis* will be then be represented with an inequality or shown to be not equivalent.

- $H_0$: $\theta = \theta_0$
- $H_A$: One of the Following:
  - $\theta > \theta_0$
  - $\theta < \theta_0$
  - $\theta \neq \theta_0$
  
The *alternative hypothesis* is the hypothesis for which we are seeking statistical evidence for.

# Test Statistic and Finding Evidence

> A test statistic is a quantity derived from the sample data and calculated assuming that the
null hypothesis is true. It is used in the decision about whether or not to reject the null
hypothesis.

# Rejection Regions and Significance Level

> The rejection region is a range of values of the test statistic that would lead you to reject
the null hypothesis.

> The significance level $\alpha$ indicates the largest probability of the test statistic occurring
under the null hypothesis that would lead you to reject the null hypothesis.

## Rejection Regions for Alternative Hypotheses

The following example uses the $z$ statistic, but the concept holds for other statistics and critical values.

| Alternative Hypothesis | Rejection Region for Level $\alpha$ Test           |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| $H_A$:  $\theta > \theta_0$    | $z \geq z_{\alpha}$                        |
| $H_A$:  $\theta < \theta_0$    | $z \leq z_{\alpha}$                        |
| $H_A$:  $\theta \neq \theta_0$ | $z \geq z_{\alpha}$ OR $z \leq \z_{\alpha}$|

# Type I and Type II Errors

## Type I Error

A **Type I** error is rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. This is actually representing by $\alpha$, where significance level is set at $100*(1-\alpha)$.

## Type II Error

A **Type II** error is failing to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false. This is normally considered *worse* than **Type I** errors.
